# What i will be doing here

* Test the app locally
* Dockerize the app
* Create a Github Action to building, testing and Lint the code on PullRequests
* Block merging if the test fails.
* Create a GitHub Action that will create a docker image from the merged code and deploy to a Container Registry (AWS ECR in this case)
